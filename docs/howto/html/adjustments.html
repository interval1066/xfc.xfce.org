      <div style="text-align: left;">XFC has various widgets that can
be visually
adjusted by the user using the mouse or the keyboard, such as <a
 href="rangewidgets.html">range
widgets</a>. There are also a few widgets that display some adjustable
portion of a larger area of data, such as the <a href="textview.html">textview</a>
widget and the <a href="scrolledwindows.html">viewport</a> widget.<br>
      <br>
Obviously, an application needs to be able to react to changes the user
makes in range widgets. One way to do this would be to have each widget
emit its own type of signal when its adjustment changes, and either
pass
the new value to the signal handler, or require it to look inside the
widget's data structure in order to ascertain the value. But you may
also want to connect the adjustments of several widgets together, so
that adjusting one adjusts the others. The most obvious example of this
is connecting a scrollbar to a panning viewport or a scrolling text
area. If each widget has its own way of setting or getting the
adjustment value, then the programmer may have to write their own
signal
handlers to translate between the output of one widget's signal and the
'input' of another's adjustment setting function.<br>
      <br>
XFC solves this problem using the Adjustment object, which is not a
widget but a way for widgets to store and pass adjustment information
in
an abstract and flexible form. The most obvious use of an Adjustment is
to
store the configuration parameters and values of range widgets, such as
scrollbars and scale controls. However, since Adjustments are derived
from Gtk::Object, they have some special powers beyond those of normal
data structures. Most importantly, they can emit signals, just like
widgets, and these signals can be used not only to allow your program
to
react to user input on adjustable widgets, but also to propagate
adjustment values transparently between adjustable widgets. You will
see how adjustments fit in when you see the other widgets that
incorporate them: <a href="progressbar.html">Progress Bars</a>,<a
 href="../../libinti/docs/tutorial/containerwidgets#CW08"></a> <a
 href="scrolledwindows.html">Scrolled Windows</a>, and
others.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="A01"></a>Creating
an Adjustment</h2>
      <div align="justify"> Many of the widgets which use
adjustment objects
do so automatically, but some cases will be shown in later examples
where you may need to create one yourself. You create an adjustment
using one of the following constructors:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Adjustment();<br>
      <br>
Adjustment(double lower, double upper, double
step_increment, double page_increment, double page_size);<br>
      <br>
Adjustment(double value, double lower, double
upper, double step_increment, double page_increment, double
page_size);</code> </div>
      <code><samp> </samp></code><em></em><br>
The 'value' argument is the initial value
you want to give to the adjustment, usually corresponding to the top
most
or left most position of an adjustable widget. The 'lower'
argument specifies the lowest value which the adjustment can hold. The
'step_increment'
argument specifies the smaller of the two increments by which the user
can change the value, while the 'page_increment<em>' </em>is the
larger one. The 'page_size' argument usually corresponds some
how to the visible area of a panning widget. The 'upper'
argument is used to represent the bottom most or right most coordinate
in a panning widget's child. Therefore it is not always the largest
number that value can take, since the page_size of such widgets is
usually non-zero.<br>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> <br>
You can create a empty Adjustment with the first constructor and then
later call set_value() and set_range() to set the adjustment fields:<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
set_value(double value);<br>
      <br>
void set_range(double
lower, double upper, double
step_increment,double page_increment, double page_size);</code> </div>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">Using the second constructor you
can set the
Adjustment's range at construction and then call set_value() later to
set the initial value. The third constructor sets both the initial
value
and range.<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="A02"></a>Using
Adjustments
the easy way</h2>
      </div>
The adjustable widgets can be roughly divided into
those which use and require specific units for the values and those
which treat them as arbitrary numbers. The group which treats the
values
as arbitrary numbers includes the range widgets (scrollbars and scales,
the progress bar widget, and the spinbutton widget). These widgets are
all the widgets which are typically 'adjusted' directly by the user
with
the mouse or keyboard. They will treat the lower and upper values of an
adjustment as a range within which the user can manipulate the
adjustment's value. By default they will only modify the value of an
adjustment.<br>
      <br>
The other group includes the textview widget, the viewport widget, the
treeview widget, and the scrolled window widget. All of these
widgets use pixel values for their adjustments. These are also all
widgets which are typically 'adjusted' indirectly using scrollbars.
While all widgets which use adjustments can either create their own
adjustments or use ones you supply, you'll generally want to let this
particular category of widgets create its own adjustments. Usually,
they
will eventually override all the values except the value itself in
whatever adjustments you give them, but the results are, in general,
undefined (meaning, you'll have to read the source code to find out,
and
it may be different from widget to widget).<br>
      <br>
Now, you're probably thinking, since textview widgets and viewports
insist
on setting everything except the value of their adjustments, while
scrollbars will only touch the adjustment's value, if you share an
adjustment object between a scrollbar and a text widget, manipulating
the scrollbar will automatically adjust the viewport widget? Of course
it will! Just like this:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>//
The viewport creates its own adjustments<br>
Gtk::Viewport *viewport = new
Gtk::Viewport;<br>
      <br>
// Use the newly-created adjustment
for the
scrollbar as well<br>
Gtk::VScollbar *vscrollbar = new
Gtk::VScrollbar(*viewport-&gt;get_vadjustment());</code> </div>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="A03"></a>Adjustment
Internals</h2>
Ok, you say, that's nice, but what if I want to
connect my own signal handlers to respond when the user adjusts a range
widget
or a spin button, and how do I get at the value of the adjustment in
these handlers? <br>
      <br>
You can use the following accessor function to inspect the value of an
adjustment:<u><font><u><font color="#003755"><br>
      <br>
      </font></u></font></u>
      <div class="fbox"><code>double
get_value() const;</code></div>
      <samp></samp><br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">When you set the value of an
Adjustment
you generally want the change to be reflected by every widget that uses
this adjustment. XFC provides this convenience method to do this:<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
set_value(double value);</code></div>
      <samp></samp><br>
As mentioned earlier, Gtk::Adjustment is derived
from Gtk::Object just like all the various widgets, and thus it is able
to emit signals. This is, of course, why updates happen automatically
when you share an adjustment object between a scrollbar and another
adjustable widget; all adjustable widgets connect signal handlers to
their adjustment's 'value_changed' signal, as can your program.
The various widgets that use the Adjustment object will emit this
signal
on an adjustment whenever they change its value. This happens both when
user input causes the slider to move on a range widget, as well as when
the program explicitly changes the value with
Gtk::Adjustment::set_value(). <br>
      <br>
So, for a class 'MyClass' with a scale widget and picture widget as
data members,
if you want to change the rotation of the picture whenever the scale
widget's value changes you could create a signal handler like this:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void <br>
MyClass::on_rotate_picture()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
picture-&gt;set_rotation(scale-&gt;get_adjustment()-&gt;get_value());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
}</code></div>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">and connect on_rotate_picture() to
the scale widget's adjustment like
this:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>scale-&gt;get_adjustment()-&gt;signal_value_changed().connect(sigc::mem_fun(this,
&amp;MyClass::on_rotate_picture));</code></div>
      <br>
What about when a widget reconfigures the upper or
lower fields of its adjustment, such as when a user adds more text to a
text buffer? In this case, it emits the 'changed' signal. Range
widgets typically connect a handler to this signal, which changes their
appearance to reflect the change - for example, the size of the slider
in a scrollbar will grow or shrink in inverse proportion to the
difference between the lower and upper values of its adjustment.<br>
      <br>
You probably won't ever need to attach a handler to this signal, unless
you're writing a new type of range widget. However, if you change any
of
the values in a Adjustment directly, you should emit this signal on it
to reconfigure whatever widgets are using it. This is done by calling
its inherited G::Object emit_by_name() method:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>G::Object::emit_by_name("changed");</code></div>
      <br>
See also the <a href="rangewidgets.html#example">Range
Widgets</a> example which connects three range widgets to one
Adjustment.<br>
