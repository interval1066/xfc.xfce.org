      <br>
Understanding the XFC object system, the decisions that went into
its design, its reference counting and its memory management will help
you to better optimize your XFC applications. Essentially, the XFC
object system integrates the functionality of the GLib object system,
the libsigc++ library and C++
memory management into one easy to use programming interface.
Achieving this required some design choices that restricted memory
management
but the end result is a secure C++ programming environment that
prevents memory leaks. <br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="OS01"></a>Design
Principles</h2>
Perhaps the
most important design issue to deal with when writing a language
binding for GTK+ is integrated memory management. There are
three possible ways a language binding can manage memory. The binding's
wrapper object can manage the life cycle of the C
object, the C object can manage the life cycle of the binding object,
or you can have a combination of the both and leave the choice
optional. <br>
      <br>
GTK+ implements a system of self aware object-oriented
classes that clean up after themselves when they're destroyed. This is
achieved through reference counting, which is the basis of memory
management in GTK+. A unique feature in GTK+ is that parent containers
manage the reference count of their children. So if you
hold onto a reference to a parent container you don't need to hold on
to
any references to the container's children, unless you have good reason.<br>
      <br>
In C++ things are done differently.&nbsp; Dynamic objects are
created
with operator new and only get destroyed when operator delete is
called. Stack objects are automatic objects that get destroyed when
they go out of scope. In C++ there is no automatic garbage collection
but implementing basic garbage collection is
very simple and a part of good C++ design. Essentially, you put the
construction and deletion of dynamic objects inside another object type
and use that type to manage the memory of the contained object. This is
how the
standard auto_ptr&lt;&gt; class works.<br>
      <br>
So how does XFC manage memory? In XFC the GTK+ C object is responsible
for managing the life
cycle of its C++ object wrapper. This design was chosen because
its implementation is a natural extension to structure and function
that
GTK+
already provides. Its main advantage is that it makes memory management
safer
and easier to use, but there is one limitation. You cannot call
operator delete on an XFC object. Instead, if you hold onto a reference
to an XFC object you must call unref() to release your reference when
your finished with the object. When the object's reference count
reaches zero XFC automatically calls operator delete on the XFC object
if
it was created by operator new. <br>
      <br>
      <h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 55, 85);"><a name="OS02"></a></span>The
Library Organization</h2>
The XFC library is organized into namespaces.
The
primary namespace is the Xfc namespace. Within this
namespace there are several secondary namespaces named according
to the GTK+ library they wrap. These are:<br>
      <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Atk</span>
- wraps the ATK accessibility
library</li>
        <li style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Gdk</span>
- wraps the GDK drawing kit and
GDK-PIXBUF image library</li>
        <li style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">G</span>
- wraps the GLIB utility library</li>
        <li style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Gtk</span>
-<em> </em>wraps
the GTK
GUI toolkit</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Pango</span>
- wraps
the Pango internationalized text handling
library</span><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
The Main namespace wraps the GTK+ main processing loop and
its associated functions and signals. There are two signals in the
Main namespace you can connect to:
      <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">quit_signal</span>
-
emitted
when an instance of the mainloop is left<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">key_snooper_signal</span>
-<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>emitted on all key
events before
delivering them
normally<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
The G namespace includes an interface for the GLib main
processing loop and
its associated functions and signals. There are four signals in the G
namespace that you can connect to:<br>
      <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">child_watch_signal</span>
- emitted
when the child being watched exits<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">timeout_signal</span>
-
emitted
at user-specified intervals<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">idle_signal</span>
-
emitted
when the event loop is idle<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">io_signal</span>
- emitted
when
a given condition is met<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
These signals don't have accessor functions because they're declared
static, and they don't require an object pointer. You connect to
these signals in the same way you would connect to any other
signal except that for some signals the connect() function takes
an extra argument. For example, the 'timeout_signal'
connect()
method takes a slot and an unsigned integer which is the time in
milliseconds that is to elapse before the slot gets called.<br>
      <br>
Xfc::Gtk is a GUI toolkit that provides a complete object orientated
widget collection, including all the widgets you might expect (windows,
dialog boxes, buttons, notebooks, text fields and so on). It has an
advanced tree and list widget with a model-view architecture. It has a
feature rich text widget that supports the editing and display of
Unicode text using the Pango internationalization subsystem. You can
also write your own custom widgets either by subclassing the abstract
Xfc::Gtk::Widget or by subclassing an existing concrete widget and
modifying its functionality.<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="OS03"></a>The
Base Class Hierarchy</h2>
The base class hierarchy in XFC looks like this:<br>
      <br>
      <div> </div>
      <div
 style="margin: 0px auto; width: 720px; height: 320px; text-align: center;"
 class="fbox" align="center"><img style="width: 720px; height: 320px;"

      <div style="text-align: center;"><small
 style="color: rgb(17, 55, 95);">XFC
base class hierarchy</small><br>
      </div>
      <br>
Xfc::Trackable is the primary base class for the entire XFC object
hierarchy. It inherits from sigc::trackable
so that XFC objects can auto-disconnect libsigc++ slots on destruction.
Xfc::Trackable, Xfc::G::TypeInstance and Xfc::G::TypeInterface are
abstract bases and generally you wont use these classes directly.<br>
      <dl>
        <dd><span style="font-weight: bold;">Xfc::Trackable</span>
is a
dynamic memory tracking class based on Item 27 in Scott Meyers book
More Effective C++. It keeps
track of heap memory allocations and ensures that XFC calls
delete on all dynamic objects. It also implements the
reference counting requirements that the XFC smart pointer
(Xfc::Pointer&lt;&gt;) needs to
work. Xfc::Trackable is derived from sigc::trackable so any object that
derives
from it can automatically use libsigc++ signals
and slots.</dd>
        <dd><br>
        </dd>
        <dd><b>Xfc::G::TypeInstance</b>
is the base class for all GObject types,
widgets and interfaces. Its main purpose is to connect an abstract
interface to a concrete object instance. Many of the classes in the
accessibility toolkit (ATK) are interface classes.</dd>
        <dd><br>
        </dd>
        <dd><b>G::TypeInterface</b>
is
the base class for all interface
classes. Interfaces are a new design feature implemented in GTK+ 2.0.
In XFC, interface classes are abstract classes that cannot be
instantiated. They must be implemented using multiple inheritance on
a concrete object. An example of such a class is Gtk::Entry which
inherits from Gtk::Widget, Gtk::Editable and Gtk::CellEditable. This
inheritance means that Gtk::Entry is a
Gtk::Widget that
implements the Gtk::Editable and Gtk::CellEditable interfaces.</dd>
      </dl>
The other base classes you will use quite frequently:<br>
      <dl>
        <dd><b>Xfc::Object</b>
is an
abstract base class that adds
one feature to Xfc::Trackable, a reference counter. Its purpose is to
implement the
reference counting features of Xfc::Trackable for objects that don't
have their own reference counter. Examples include Xfc::G::Boxed,
Xfc::G::Scanner, Xfc::Gdk::Region, Xfc::Gtk::TargetList and
Xfc::Pango::Attribute. To implement your own reference counted classes
that can be managed with Xfc::Pointer&lt;&gt; derive your class
from
Xfc::Object.<br>

        <dd><br>
        </dd>
        <dd><b>Xfc::G::Boxed</b>
is
the base class for all boxed
objects. In GTK+, boxed objects are small opaque structures that are
registered by the GLib type system. Examples of boxed objects include
Xfc::Gdk::Color, Xfc::Gdk::Cursor, Xfc::G::Value, Xfc::Gtk::IconSet,
Xfc::Gtk::TextAttributes and Xfc::Pango::FontDescription.&nbsp;</dd>
        <dd><br>

      <h2><a name="OS04"></a>Reference
Counting</h2>
The life cycle of an XFC object is controlled by its reference count,
so it's important you understand reference counting. If you're already
familiar GTK+ reference counting then you already understand XFC
reference counting. XFC integrates GTK+ reference counting
into its memory management scheme, and uses the same reference counting
rules.<br>
      <br>
An XFC reference counted object is created with an initial reference
count of 1. When you create a G::Object that is not Gtk::Object you own
the initial reference. So you must call unref() to release the
reference when the object is no
longer required.
An example of&nbsp; G::Objects are Gtk::AccelGroup and Gtk::Style.
When
you
create a Gtk::Object you don't own the initial reference, instead
it's a floating reference that keeps the object alive until
some other object claims ownership. A
floating reference can be removed by anyone at any time by calling
ref().
The first call to ref() will also sink a Gtk::Object so there is no
sink()
function. Most widget code assumes that only a Gtk::Container will call
ref() to hold onto a reference to a
child widget. If you create a Gtk::Object and never pass
it to an owner you have to call ref() yourself and later call unref().
If you never call unref() it causes a memory leak. An Xfc::Object, just
like
G::Object, is created with a reference count of 1 that is owned by the
caller and must be released later by calling unref(). All Xfc::G::Boxed
objects are derived from Xfc::Object.<br>
      <br>
Gtk::Window is an exception to the rule. Its initial
reference is owned by GTK+ so you only need to call unref() if
you first called ref(). To destroy a Gtk::Window you must explicitly
call dispose(), not unref(). When emitted, a destroy
signal requests that reference owners drop there
references. This causes Gtk::Container to drop its references to child
widgets, and GTK+ to drop its reference to a top level Gtk::Window.
This normally leads to object finalization, unless some other object
is holding onto a reference. <br>
      <br>
If your a GTK+ programmer these rules should sound familiar to you
because they're the GTK+ reference
counting
rules. The advantage in using GTK+ reference counting is that
it keeps memory management consistent across the XFC and GTK+ libraries.<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="OS05"></a>Memory
Management</h2>
How do you prevent memory leaks? By writing code that
doesn't contain any! <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/">Bjarne
Stroustrup</a> says "Clearly, if
your code has
new
operations, delete operations, and pointer arithmetic all over the
place,
you are going to mess up
somewhere and get leaks, stray pointers, etc.
This is true independently of how conscientious you are with your
allocations:
eventually the complexity
of the code will overcome the time and effort you can afford.
It follows that successful
techniques rely on hiding allocation and deallocation inside more
manageable
types".<br>
      <br>
XFC partially implements this approach to memory management by hiding
deallocation inside the GTK+ reference counting scheme. This helps to
prevent of memory leaks and makes memory
management much safer and easier to use. It also ensures consistent and
familiar memory
management techniques across the XFC and GTK+ libraries. <br>
      <br>
So how does XFC's memory management actually work? Xfc::Trackable keeps
track of
all
dynamic memory allocations. When a new XFC object is created XFC
installs a C callback function that
gets
called when the wrapped C object is destroyed. If the XFC object was
created on the heap the callback function<em></em>
will call operator
delete. This leads to the most important&nbsp; rule of
memory management in XFC:<strong>
you must never call </strong><strong>delete
on an XFC object</strong>. If the
object was created
by operator new, XFC will automatically call delete when the object's
reference count reaches zero.
      <dl>
      </dl>
When you want to destroy an XFC object you either call unref()
or dispose()<em>.</em>
You would call unref() if you are
holding onto a reference to an object and you would call dispose()
if you are not. Calling unref() drops an object's reference count but
the object wont be destroyed until its reference count reaches zero.
Calling dispose() generates a destroy
signal which tells all reference holders to release their reference so
the object can be destroyed.<br>
      <br>
To create an XFC object on the heap you have to call operator new.
The new object is created with an initial reference count of 1. If the
object is a G::Object but not a Gtk::Object, you own the object's
initial reference and must call
unref() at some stage.<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gtk::AccelGroup
*group = new Gtk::AccelGroup;<br>
... // use group, e.g. pass to
a
Gtk::MenuItem constructor<br>
group-&gt;unref();</code> </div>
      <br>
When you pass a Gtk::AccelGroup (or any other G::Object) to an
owner, the owner will hold onto a reference to the object so you can
safely call unref(). If the object is a Gtk::Object its initial
reference will be a floating reference. If you pass a Gtk::Object to
an owner, like Gtk::Container you don't have to call unref() because
the owner will call ref() to hold onto a reference to the object and
will sink the object to clear the floating reference. For example:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gtk::VBox
*vbox = new Gtk::VBox;<br>
add(*vbox);</code></div>
      <br>
If for some reason you want to hold onto a reference
to a
Gtk::Object you passed to an owner you have to call ref() and
later unref(). In XFC there is no sink() function. Calling ref() for
the first time on
a
Gtk::Object will automatically sink the object if it has a floating
reference. If you want to hold onto a pointer to a widget you added to
a container, for later use, you don't need to call ref(). It is safe
to use the pointer as long as the container is valid because
the container holds onto a reference to the widget and will only call
unref() when the container itself gets destroyed.<br>
      <br>
You don't need to release the initial reference for a G::Object created
on the stack. Stack objects are automatic objects and as such will
automatically release their initial reference when they go out of
scope. That means you only need to call unref() on a stack object if
you first
called ref(). Dialog boxes (which are a windows) are an exception.
When you create a modal dialog
box by calling run() you must call dispose() to destroy the dialog
box, not unref().<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gtk::MessageDialog
*dialog = new
Gtk::MessageDialog(Gtk::MESSAGE_INFO, Gtk::BUTTONS_CLOSE, this);<br>
dialog-&gt;set_message("This is a message");<br>
if (dialog-&gt;run())<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dialog-&gt;dispose();</code> </div>
      <br>
Xfc::Object is a reference counting base class that provides the
reference counting
facilities required to implement automatic memory management for those
objects that don't derive from G::Object. Examples of such objects
include G::Boxed,
G::Date, G::Scanner, G::Timer, Gdk::Region, Gtk::TargetList and
Pango::Attribute. Like G::Objects, Xfc::Objects can either be created
dynamically
with operator new or declared as automatic variables on the stack.
Dynamically allocated Xfc::Objects must be explicitly
unreferenced with unref(), so that operator delete gets called. If you
don't
want to be bothered calling unref() just use an XFC smart pointer and
it will call unref() for you. As with&nbsp; G::Objects,
Xfc::Objects
declared on the stack don't need
to be unreferenced, unless you first called ref().<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="OS06"></a>The
XFC
Smart Pointer</h2>
The XFC smart pointer (Xfc::Pointer&lt;&gt;) is a reference
counting
smart pointer that manages the life cycle of the object it points to by
calling ref() and unref(). Unlike other reference counting smart
pointers, Xfc::Pointer&lt;&gt; is GTK+ aware because it knows
the
difference between a G::Object and Gtk::Object, and handles their
initial reference counts appropriately. So make sure you only use a
XFC
smart pointer on XFC objects.<br>
      <br>
To use Xfc::Pointer&lt;&gt; just pass the name of the object it
will
point to as the template argument. For example:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Pointer&lt;Gtk::AccelGroup&gt;
group = new Gtk::AccelGroup;<br>
... // use group. unref() is
called
when group goes out of scope</code> </div>
      <br>
Xfc::Pointer&lt;&gt; is always used as a stack object so
unref()
automatically gets
called on the object pointed to when it goes out of scope. <br>
      <br>
How does Xfc::Pointer&lt;&gt; know the difference between a
G::Object
and a Gtk::Object? That's what the second argument 'owns_reference'
is for in an
object's protected constructor.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">
      </span>If owns_reference is
true the caller owns the initial
reference and must call unref() to release it. If owns_reference is
false the caller does not own the initial reference and only needs to
call unref() if ref() was first called. When owns_reference is false
the caller must either pass the object to an owner object, such as a
container, or call ref(). Not passing an object to an owner object and
not calling ref() will cause a memory leak. Look at these protected
constructors:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>G::Object(GObject
*object, bool
owns_reference = true);<br>
      <br>
Gtk::AccelGroup(GtkAccelGroup *group, bool owns_reference = true);<br>
      <br>
Gtk::Object(GtkObject
*object, bool
owns_reference = false);<br>
      <br>
Gtk::Widget(GtkWidget *widget, bool owns_reference = false);<br>
      <br>
Gtk::Window(GtkWindow *window, bool
owns_reference = false);</code> </div>
      <code></code>
      <div align="justify"><br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">Examining
the default value of
owns_reference in these
constructors you can see that for G::Object
owns_reference is true so the caller owns the initial reference count.
Gtk::AccelGroup derives directly from G::Object so owns_reference is
also true and the caller owns the initial reference count. For
Gtk::Object, Gtk::Widget and Gtk::Window owns_reference is false
so the
caller does not own the initial reference. For&nbsp;all Gtk::
objects
and widgets the initial reference is a floating reference, except for
Gtk::Window. GTK+ owns all top level windows, including dialogs. At
construction GTK+ references and sinks a window clearing its floating
reference, so you should only call unref() on a top level window if you
first called ref(). <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
      </div>
      <br>
When you assign an object pointer
to a Xfc::Pointer&lt;&gt;, the smart pointer examines the
value of
owns_reference<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>If
owns_reference is true <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it
doesn't call ref() on pointer acquisition.&nbsp; Instead, it takes
over
ownership of the object's initial reference count and sets
owns_reference to false. If owns_reference is false ref() is called on
pointer acquisition. When a smart pointer goes out of scope it always
calls unref() on the object it points to.<br>
      <br>
If your new to GTK+ programming and find the GTK+ reference counting
rules too complex you can always use a XFC smart pointer for all
objects you create with operator new. The smart pointer will know how
handle reference counting correctly for all XFC objects. As you become
more experienced you can then start using smart pointers only when you
need to. If you take a look and the widget demonstration program and
example applications that come with libXFCui, you will notice that a
smart pointer is used for all objects that need their initial reference
released. This makes programming a lot easier and avoids all those
direct calls to unref().<br>
      <br>
This is a good place to talk about the use of XFC smart pointers as
function arguments and return values. If a member function returns a
pointer to an object that has had its reference count incremented and
must be unreferenced, the pointer is returned as a smart pointer.
Otherwise it is returned as a normal (dumb) pointer. But you can always
assign the returned dumb pointer to a smart pointer if you prefer.<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="OS07"></a>The
Truth
about Memory Leaks</h2>
The truth about memory leaks is
that XFC cannot leak memory, but be warned XFC is not a garbage
collector and must not be used that way. As mentioned earlier XFC
tracks all dynamic memory allocations. It does this by storing a
pointer to all memory allocated by operator new in a
std::list&lt;&gt;.
The newest allocations are pushed onto the front of the list. When
operator delete is called on a dynamic object the list is searched from
the front. When the object pointer is found it is removed from the list
and the object it points to is deleted. This is quite fast because as a
program
executes and transient dynamic objects are created and destroyed, the
most recent pointers will aways be found at the front of the list.<br>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
As a safe guard, when a program terminates the allocation list is
iterated over and any pointers found in the list are deleted. This only
deletes an object's raw memory and not the actual object pointed to
because the actual object type is not known. Object destructors are
not called either. So its up to you to learn the GTK+ reference
counting rules
and use them correctly.<br>
      <br>
Why is the allocation list needed? The main reason is to prevent
memory leaks. For a language binding there are many potential memory
leaks because GTK+ creates a lot of global objects that don't get
destroyed until the GTK+ libraries are removed from memory. If you use
the GNOME desktop GTK+ will not be removed from memory and those global
objects wont get destroyed until GNOME is shut down. The destruction of
a C object's C++ wrapper relies on the callback notification that
occurs when a C object is destroyed. For global GTK+ objects that
notification wont occur until after an application terminates, and so
any global C++ wrappers used wont get deleted. Over time this can add
up
to a significant memory leak. What the XFC allocation list does is trap
these pointers and reclaims the raw memory allocated to them when a
program terminates. As an added bonus any stray pointers not
unreferenced properly will also get trapped and their memory reclaimed.
So should you make a
mistake in your application it wont leak memory.<br>
