      <h1>The
TextView Widget</h1>
      <br>
GTK+ has an extremely powerful
framework for multi-line text editing. The primary objects involved in
the process are TextBuffer, which represents the text
being edited, and<strong> </strong>TextView,
a widget which can
display
a
TextBuffer. Each buffer can be displayed by any number of views.<br>
      <br>
One of the important things to remember about text in GTK+ is that it's
in the UTF-8 encoding. This means that one character can be encoded as
multiple bytes. Character counts are usually referred to as offsets,
while byte counts are called indexes. If you confuse these two, things
will work fine with ASCII, but as soon as your buffer contains
multi-byte
characters, bad things will happen.<br>
      <br>
You can create a TextView widget using the following constructors:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>TextView();<br>
      <br>
TextView(Gtk::TextBuffer&amp; buffer);</code> </div>
      <br>
The first constructor creates a text view widget with an empty default
buffer. The second constructor creates a text view widget initialized
with the specified 'buffer'.<br>
      <br>
You can set and/or retrieve the text buffer using these TextView
methods:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
set_buffer(Gtk::TextBuffer
*buffer);<br>
      <br>
Gtk::TextBuffer* get_buffer() const;</code></div>
      <br>
Text in a buffer can be marked with tags. A tag is an attribute that
can be applied to some range of text. Tags can have names, which is
convenient sometimes (for example, you
can name your tag that makes text bold "bold"), but they can also be
anonymous (which is convenient if you're creating tags on-the-fly).
Tags don't have to affect appearance. They
can instead affect the behavior of mouse and key presses, 'lock' a
range
of text so the user can't edit it, or countless other things. A tag is
represented by a TextTag object. One TextTag can be
applied to any number of text ranges in any number of buffers.<br>
      <br>
Each tag is stored in a TextTagTable. A tag table
defines a set of tags that can be used together. Each buffer has one
tag
table associated with it; only tags from that tag table can be used
with
the buffer. A useful optimization is to create a TextTagTable in
advance, and reuse the same tag table for all the buffers with the same
tag set, instead of creating new copies of the same tags for every
buffer. Tags are assigned default priorities in order of addition to
the tag table. That is, tags created later that affect the same text
property affected by an earlier tag will override the earlier tag. <br>
      <br>
You can create a new tag with one of these constructors:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>TextTag();<br>
      <br>
TextTag(const
String&amp;
name);</code></div>
      <br>
The first constructor creates an anonymous tag and the second
constructor creates a tag with the specified name. Anonymous tags are
convenient if you are creating tags on-the-fly, otherwise tags should
have a name. After creating a tag you need to add it to the buffer's
tag table before you can apply it to any text in the buffer.<br>
      <br>
The following TextBuffer method returns a buffer's tag table:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gtk::TextTagTable*
get_tag_table() const;</code></div>
      <br>
To create a "Bold" tag and add it to a text buffer's tag table, you
would do something like this:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gtk::TextTag
*tag = new
Gtk::TextTag("Bold");<br>
tag-&gt;property_weight().set(Pango::WEIGHT_BOLD);<br>
text_buffer-&gt;get_tag_table()-&gt;add(*tag);</code></div>
      <br>
In the second line the tag's 'weight' property is set to
Pango::WEIGHT_BOLD. This is how you manipulate text tags, through
properties not getter and setter functions. There are 62 properties
that can be set on a text tag.<br>
      <br>
There is an easier way to create and add a text tag to a text buffer;
call one of the TextBuffer create methods which creates a new tag and
adds it to its tag table:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gtk::TextTag*
create_tag();<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Gtk::TextTag* create_tag(const
String&amp; tag_name);</code></div>
      <br>
Like the TextTag constructors, the first create_tag() method creates an
anonymous tag and the second creates a tag with the specified name.
Note, the returned tag is owned by the buffer's tag table, so the
reference count will be equal to one. <br>
      <br>
Now we can simplify creating a "Bold" tag and adding it to a buffer's
tag table:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gtk::TextTag
*tag = <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">text_buffer</span>-&gt;create_tag("Bold");<br>
tag-&gt;property_weight().set(Pango::WEIGHT_BOLD);</code></div>
      <br>
Most text manipulation is accomplished with iterators, represented by a
TextIter object.
An iterator represents a position between two characters in a text
buffer. TextIter is a class designed to be allocated on the stack; it's
guaranteed to be copyable by value and never contain any heap-allocated
data. Iterators are not valid indefinitely; whenever the buffer is
modified in a way that affects the number of characters in the buffer,
all outstanding iterators become invalid. (Note that deleting 5
characters and then reinserting 5 still invalidates iterators, though
you end up with the same number of characters you pass through a state
with a different number).<br>
      <br>
After adding a tag to a buffer's tag table you can apply the tag to
some
range of text in the buffer. This can be done by calling one of
the TextBuffer apply methods, or by calling one of the insert methods
which will apply the tag to the text the method inserts.<br>
      <br>
Here is one of the TextBuffer apply methods:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
apply_tag(Gtk::TextTag&amp; tag, const
TextIter&amp; start, const
TextIter&amp; end);</code></div>
      <br>
The 'tag' argument is the tag (that must be in the&nbsp; buffer's
tag
table) whose properties should be applied to the text in the range
'start' to 'end'. <br>
      <br>
Here is one of the TextBuffer insert methods:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
insert_with_tag(Gtk::TextIter&amp; iter, const
String&amp; text,
Gtk::TextTag&amp; tag);</code></div>
      <br>
The 'iter' argument is an iterator to a position in the buffer, 'text'
is the text string to insert at this position and 'tag' is the text tag
to apply to the text. There are other insert methods that can insert
text without specifying a tag, insert text at the current cursor
position or insert pixbufs. You should have a look at the TextBuffer
and TextTag API reference. The functions are all well documentated.<br>
      <br>
Iterators can't be used to preserve positions across
buffer modifications. To preserve a position you need to use a TextMark
object. You can think of a mark as an invisible cursor or
insertion point; it floats in the buffer, saving a position. If the
text
surrounding the mark is deleted, the mark remains in the position the
text once occupied; if text is inserted at the mark, the mark ends up
either to the left or to the right of the new text, depending on its
gravity. The standard text cursor in left-to-right languages is a mark
with right gravity, because it stays to the right of inserted text.<br>
      <br>
Like tags, marks can be either named or anonymous. There are two marks
built-in to TextBuffer; these are named "insert" and "selection_bound"
and refer to the insertion point and the boundary of the selection
which
is not the insertion point, respectively. If no text is selected, these
two marks will be in the same position. You can manipulate what is
selected and where the cursor appears by moving these marks around. <br>
      <br>
Unlike tags, you can't construct a mark. The only way to create a mark
is the call the TextBuffer create_mark() method:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gtk::TextMark*
create_mark(const
String&amp; mark_name, const
TextIter&amp; where, bool
left_gravity);</code></div>
      <br>
The 'mark_name' argument is the name for the mark, 'where' is the
position in the buffer to place the mark, and 'left_gravity' specifies
whether the mark should have left or right gravity. If mark_name is
null, the mark is anonymous. If a mark has left gravity, and text is
inserted at the mark's current location, the mark will be moved to the
left of the newly-inserted text. If the mark has right gravity
(left_gravity = false), the mark will end up on the right of
newly-inserted text. The standard left-to-right cursor is a mark with
right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the right side of the
text you're typing). The caller of this method does not own a reference
to the returned TextMark, so you can ignore the return value if you
like. Marks are owned by the buffer and go away when the buffer does. <code></code><br>
      <br>
An anchor is a spot in a TextBuffer where child widgets can be
anchored, inserted inline, as if they were characters. An anchor,
represented by TextChildAnchor, can have multiple widgets anchored, to
allow for multiple views.<br>
      <br>
The easiest way to create an anchor it to call the TextBuffer
create_child_anchor() method:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gtk::TextChildAnchor*
create_child_anchor(Gtk::TextIter&amp; iter);</code></div>
      <br>
The 'iter' argument is the position in the buffer to place the anchor.
The new anchor is owned by the buffer so no reference count is returned
to the caller. Have a look at the&nbsp; TextView demo program in
&lt;demos/xfc-demo/textview.cc&gt;. It displays a text buffer
that has
several widgets anchored.<br>
      <br>
The one thing not covered yet is creating a text buffer. That's easy,
but as you saw at the start, if you don't specify a text buffer when
you create a TextView widget, the widget creates an default buffer for
you.<br>
      <br>
You can create a text buffer by calling the following constructor:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>TextBuffer(Gtk::TextTagTable
*table = 0);</code></div>
      <br>
You could create your own buffer when you want to reuse one
TexTagTable, or when you want to display one buffer in multiple text
views. Text buffers always contain at least one line, but may be empty
(that
is, buffers can contain zero characters). The last line in the text
buffer never ends in a line separator (such as newline); the other
lines
in the buffer always end in a line separator. Line separators count as
characters when computing character counts and character offsets. Note
that some Unicode line separators are represented with multiple bytes
in
UTF-8, and the two-character sequence "\r\n" is also considered a line
separator.<br>
      <br>
One TextBuffer method worth mentioning is place_cursor():<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
place_cursor(const
TextIter&amp; where);</code></div>
      <br>
This method lets you place the cursor in response to a user action,
moving both "insert" and "selection_bound" marks simultaneously without
causing a temporary selection (moving one mark then the other
temporarily
selects the range in between the old and new positions). The 'where'
argument is the position in the buffer to place the cursor. <br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="example"></a>TextView
Example</h2>
There are two ways to affect text attributes in a TextView. You can
change the default attributes for a given TextView widget, or you can
apply
tags that change the attributes for a region of text. For text features
that come from the theme - such as font and foreground color - use
standard Gtk::Widget methods such as modify_font() or modify_text().
For
other attributes, there are dedicated methods on TextView such as
set_tabs(); Here is a simple example that changes a text view's default
font, text color and left margin, and sets the text color for a region
of text to blue. <br>

      <h2>Compiling TextView<br>
      </h2>
If you compiled and installed XFC yourself, you will find the source
code for TextView in the
&lt;examples/howto/textview&gt; source directory along with a Makefile. If
XFC came pre-installed, or you installed it from an RPM package, you
will
find the source code in the
&lt;/usr/share/doc/xfcui-X.X/examples/howto/textview&gt; subdirectory. In
this case you will have to create the Makefile yourself (replace X.X
with the
version number of the libXFCui library you have installed).<br>
      <br>
To create a Makefile for TextView, add the following lines to a new
text
file
and save it using the name "Makefile":<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>CC = g++<br>
      <br>
CFLAGS = -Wall -O2<br>
      <br>
textview: textview.cc textview.hh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $(CC) textview.cc -o textview $(CFLAGS) `pkg-config
xfcui-X.X --cflags --libs`<br>
      <br>
clean: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rm -f *.o textview</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
If you cut and paste these lines make sure the whitespace before $(CC)
and rm is a tab character. When
you
compile and run this program you will see the following window appear:<br>
