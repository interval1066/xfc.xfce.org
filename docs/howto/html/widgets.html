      <h2><a name="W01"></a>Overview</h2>
A widget is the on-screen representation of a graphical user
interface element that
can be manipulated by the user. Windows, menus, buttons and scrollbars
are all examples of widgets. A widget type is implemented as a
class that defines the functionality and attributes of a widget.
Widgets are arranged into a hierarchy of classes. Each widget in the
hierarchy inherits the attributes of its base widget class and adds
some new
functionality. For example, Gtk::Dialog is derived from Gtk::Window so
it is a window, but it comes prepacked with a vertical box, a
horizontal button box and a horizontal separator. <br>
      <br>
There are
several ways to classify widgets:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Containers</span>
are widgets that store other widgets inside, such as <a
 href="boxes.html">boxes</a>
and <a href="tables.html">tables</a>.
Containers can be subdivided into those that add functionality to a
single child (such as Button, Frame, or EventBox), and those that
manage layout for multiple widgets (such as Box or Table). <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Composite</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
widgets</span> are containers that
come prepacked with useful child widgets.
For example, the FileChooserDialog is a subclass of Gtk::Window
that contains a combobox, several dialog
buttons and a TreeView widget to display a list of files. Composite
widgets are easy to write and are a
convenient way to reuse code in an application.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-container
widgets</span> can be actual
controls (buttons or scroll bars), information displays
(labels),
or decorative elements (separators). Widgets that need to receive
events or draw their own background have an associated Gdk::Window.
Widgets that have no Gdk::Window draw on their parent container and are
called 'no window' widgets.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
Gtk::Widget is
the base class for all widgets in XFC. Widgets are very easy to use.
You
can create an instance of a standard widget and add it
to a container, you can derive your own widget class from a standard
widget and add some new functionality, you can write a <a
 href="composite_widgets.html">composite widget</a>,
or you can
create your own <a href="custom_widgets.html">custom widget</a>
class from scratch. Widgets provide public methods
that can be called to set widget-specific attributes such as widget
size or position. When
a user interacts with a widget,
such as pulling down a menu and making a selection, clicking a button,
or moving a scrollbar the widget emits a signal. An application needs
to respond to these signal emissions by calling a callback slot that
you
supply.
A callback slot is a C++ function object (functor) that calls the class
member or static function
that you want attached to a user action.<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="W02"></a>Life
Cycle of a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Widget </h2>
      <h2><span class="qindexF"></span></h2>
Widget resource and <a href="object_system.html#OS05">memory
management</a> is mostly automatic
in XFC. However, there are a couple
of
'gotchas' to keep in mind if
you're doing more complicated things. Internally, a <a
 href="object_system.html#OS04">reference
count</a> is maintained for all
widgets (actually, all G::Objects). Widgets begin
their life with an initial reference count of 1. At this stage the
widget is said to be 'floating' and
is flagged as such. Removing a widget's initial
reference is called 'sinking' the floating object and would
destroy the widget if the floating reference was the only one. <br>
      <br>
Containers first reference and then sink any floating widgets that are
added to them. By sinking a widget, a container 'takes ownership' of it
for resource management purposes. Thus, the reference count of the
widget remains 1, but the object is no longer flagged as floating. When
a widget is removed from a container, or the container is
destroyed, the reference count is decremented to 0. When an object's
reference count reaches 0, it is destroyed. <br>
      <br>
In practice, this means that you only have to destroy top level
widgets; any widgets that are inside a container will be destroyed
along with the container. There's a danger here, however. Sometimes you
want to remove a widget
from a container; perhaps some element of your interface is optional or
only appears under certain circumstances. When you remove the widget
(using Gtk::Container::remove()), it will be unreferenced, its
reference count will drop to 0, and it will be destroyed. To avoid this
situation, you should add a reference to the widget before you remove
it. <br>
      <br>
Use the following inherited G::Object methods to manipulate a widget's
reference count:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>virtual
void ref();<br>
      <br>
virtual void unref();</code> </div>
      <br>
The ref() and unref() methods respectively increment and decrement the
reference count of a widget. They are declared virtual for XFC's
internal use only and are not meant to be overridden. The reason ref()
and unref() are declared virtual is so XFC can handle
floating references automatically, which leads to the next point.
The first call to ref() will automatically reference and then sink a
widget if it has been flagged as floating, so there is no sink function.<br>
      <br>
To safely remove a widget from a container, you might
do this:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>widget-&gt;ref();<br>
container-&gt;remove(*widget);</code></div>
      <br>
The widget now has one
reference, held by your code. At some point you will need to release
the
reference, destroying the widget. It would make sense to do so after
re-adding the widget to some other container. Removing
widgets from containers is uncommon; in general it's
faster to simply hide the widget with Gtk::Widget::hide(), then show it
again with Gtk::Widget::show() some
later time. <br>
      <br>
A widget can be destroyed at any
time by calling its inherited dispose method:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>widget-&gt;dispose();</code></div>
      <br>
Destroying a widget frees any associated memory and resources. If
the widget is inside a container, it is automatically removed from the
container before it's destroyed. <br>
      <br>
It is important to remember these few simple rules: <br>
      <ul>
        <li> You must destroy any
top level widgets when you are done with them, but child widgets are
destroyed automatically. </li>
        <li> If you want to
remove a widget from a container without destroying it, you must first
add a reference to the widget. </li>
        <li> If you add a
reference to a widget, you are responsible for unreferencing the widget
again when you're done with it.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>
      <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="W03"></a></span>Setting
Widget Attributes</h2>
      <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h2>
After creating a widget you will need to set one or more attributes so
it behaves as expected. The universal attribute you need to
set&nbsp; is the widget's visibility flag. This is done by calling
one
of the following Gtk::Widget show methods:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
show();<br>
      <br>
void show_all();</code> </div>
      <br>
Any widget that isn't shown will not appear on the screen. If you want
to show all the widgets in a container, it's easier to call show_all()
rather individually calling show()
for each widget. Remember, you have to show the containers containing a
widget,
in addition to the widget itself, before it will appear on screen. <br
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
      <br>
The hide methods reverse the effects of the show methods causing the
widget to be hidden (invisible to the user):<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
hide();<br>
      <br>
void hide_all();</code> </div>
      <br>
The show() and hide() methods are also signals and so have
corresponding proxy signal functions and virtual signal handlers. You
seldom, if ever, need to connect to or override these signals.<br>
      <br>
For widgets that can be 'activated' (such as buttons and menu items)
the
next method activates them:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>bool
activate();</code></div>
      <br>
Activation is what happens when you press
'Enter' on a widget during key navigation; clicking a button, selecting
a
menu item, etc. If the widget can't be activated, the method returns
false.<br>
      <br>
Rather than move a widget from one container to another yourself you
can call the following method:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
reparent(Gtk::Widget&amp; new_parent);</code></div>
      <br>
which reparents the widget handling the reference counting
issues to avoid destroying the widget. The 'new_parent' argument is the
new container for the widget.<br>
      <br>
When you want a widget to have the keyboard
focus call this next method. <br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
grab_focus();</code></div>
      <br>
The widget must be a focusable widget, such as a Gtk::Entry;
something like Gtk::Frame won't work. (More precisely, it must have the
Gtk::CAN_FOCUS flag set.)<br>
      <br>
Widgets can be named, which allows you to refer to them from a gtkrc
file. You can apply a style to widgets with a particular name in the
gtkrc file (see the GTK+ documentation for more information). Call the
following methods to set
and get a widget name:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
set_name(const String&amp; name);<br>
      <br>
String get_name() const;</code> </div>
      <br>
You can set the minimum size of a widget; that is, the widget's 'size
request':<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
set_size_request(int width, int height);</code></div>
      <br>
The 'width' and 'height' are the width and height the widget should
request, in pixels, or -1 to unset, in which case the natural size
request will be used instead. The size request of a widget is the
smallest size a
widget can accept while still functioning well and drawing itself
correctly. In some strange cases a widget may be allocated less than
its
requested size, and in many cases a widget may be allocated more space
than it requested. Passing (0,0) to this method means 'as small as
possible'. <br>
      <br>
      <samp></samp>In
most cases, Gtk::Window::set_default_size() is a
better choice for
top level windows than this method; setting the default size will still
allow users to shrink the window. Setting the size request will force
them to leave the window at least as large as the size request. <br>
      <br>
      <u>Note the inherent danger
of setting any fixed size; themes,
translations into other languages, different fonts, and user action can
all change the appropriate size for a given widget. So, it's basically
impossible to hard code a size that will always be correct.<br>
      </u><br>
You can also get the size request for a widget that was explicitly set
using set_size_request(). <br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
get_size_request(int *width, int *height) const;</code></div>
      <br>
A return value of -1 for width or
height indicates that that dimension has not been set explicitly and
the
natural requisition of the widget is being being used.<br>
      <br>
Commonly you will want to alter one or more widget style attributes.
You should not call this method unless you know what you are doing:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
set_style(Gtk::Style&amp; style);</code></div>
      <br>
It interacts badly with themes, because
themes work by replacing the Gtk::Style. Instead, you should use
one of the Gtk::Widget 'modify style' methods:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
modify_style(Gtk::RcStyle&amp;
style);<br>
      <br>
void modify_fg(StateType state, const Gdk::Color*
color);<br>
      <br>
void modify_bg(StateType state, const Gdk::Color
*color);<br>
      <br>
void modify_text(StateType state, const Gdk::Color
*color);<br>
      <br>
void modify_base(StateType state, const Gdk::Color
*color);<br>
      <br>
void modify_font(const Pango::FontDescription
*font_desc);</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
The first method, modify_style(), allows you to set multiple attributes
at one time by specifying a new RcStyle. Modifications made using this
method take precedence over style values set via an RC file.
RcStyle&nbsp; is designed so each field can either be set or unset,
so
it is possible, using this method, to modify some style values and
leave the others unchanged. Modifications made take precedence over
style values set via an RC file, however, they will be
overridden if a style is explicitly set on the widget using
set_style(). Modifications made are not cumulative with previous calls
to modify_style() or with such
functions as modify_fg(). If you wish to retain previous values, you
must first call
get_modifier_style(), make your modifications to the returned style,
then
call modify_style() with that style. On the other hand, if you first
call
modify_style(), subsequent calls to such methods as modify_fg() will
have a
cumulative effect with the initial modifications.<br>
      <br>
The other modify methods are convenience methods that let you change
one style attribute. modify_fg() and modify_bg() set the foreground and
background colors respectively for a widget in
a particular state. modify_text() and modify_base() set the text and
base colors respectively for a widget in
a particular state. modify_font() sets the font to use for the widget.<br>
      <br>
To modify the font a label widget should use, do something like this:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Pango::FontDescription
font_desc(font_name);<br>
label-&gt;modify_font(&amp;font_desc);<br>
      </code> </div>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="W04"></a>Other
Widget Concepts</h2>
There are a few other widget concepts that you need to be aware of,
including
sensitivity, focus and widget states. <br>
      <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sensitivity</span></h3>
      <h3> </h3>
Widgets can be sensitive or insensitive. Insensitive widgets are grayed
out and do not respond to user input. Insensitive widgets are known as
inactive, disabled, or ghosted in some other toolkits. You can call the
following method to change a widget's sensitivity:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
set_sensitive(bool sensitive);</code></div>
      <br>
If the 'sensitive' argument is true, the user can interact with the
widget, otherwise the widget is insensitive. By default GTK+ sets the
sensitivity to true. A widget is only 'really' sensitive if all its
parents are sensitive. The sensitivity of a widget can be tested with
the following three
functions:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>bool
is_sensitive() const;<br>
      <br>
bool sensitive() const;<br>
      <br>
bool parent_sensitive() const;<br>
      </code></div>
      <br>
sensitive() returns true if the widget is sensitive and
parent_sensitive() returns true if the widget's parent is sensitive.
is_sensitive() returns true only if both the widget and
all its parents are sensitive. The sensitivity of the widget itself
only matters if the widget's parent is sensitive. For example, you can
set the sensitivity of an entire container full of widgets just by
setting the sensitivity of the container.<br>
      <h3>Focus</h3>
Within each top-level window, only one widget at a time can have the
keyboard focus. Any key events received by the top-level window are
forwarded to the focused widget. This is important because typing
something on the keyboard should have only one effect - changing only
one text entry field, for example. <br>
      <br>
Most widgets will give some visual indication that they have the
current focus. Using the default GTK+ theme, the focused widget is
typically surrounded by a thin black frame. The user can move the focus
between widgets, using the arrow keys or the Tab key. Focus can also
move to a widget if the user clicks it. <br>
      <br>
The following two functions test whether a widget can have, or has the
focus:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>bool
can_focus() const;<br>
      <br>
bool has_focus() const;</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
can_focus() returns true if a widget is able to handle focus grabs and
has_focus() returns true if a widget has grabbed the focus, and no
other widget has done so more recently. The concept of focus is
important for keyboard navigation. For example, pressing Enter or the
space bar 'activates' many widgets if they have the focus; you can move
between buttons with the Tab key, and press one with Space, for example.<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>bool
is_focus() const;</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
The is_focus() function returns true if the widget is the focus widget
within its top-level window. <br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
grab_focus();</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
Calling grab_focus() causes the widget to have the keyboard focus for
the window it's inside. The widget must be a focusable widget, such as
an Entry; something like Frame won't work. More precisely, can_focus()
must return true.<br>
      <h3>Grabs</h3>
Widgets can grab the pointer and keyboard away from other widgets. This
essentially means that the widget becomes 'modal': input goes only to
that widget, and the focus can't be changed to another widget. A
typical reason to grab input is to create a modal dialog; if a window
has the grab, interaction with other windows is blocked. The widget
grab methods are declared in the Main namespace. <br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
Main::grab_add(Gtk::Widget&amp;
widget);</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
After calling grab_add() to make 'widget' the current grab widget, all
mouse and keyboard interaction with other widgets in the same
application is blocked. To remove the grab from the current grab widget
call:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
Main::grab_remove(Gtk::Widget&amp;
widget);</code></div>
      <br>
You have to pair calls to grab_add() and grab_remove(). To determine if
a widget currently has the grab call this next function:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gtk::Widget*
Main::grab_get_current();</code></div>
      <br>
If no widget has the grab, grab_get_current() returns null. These grabs
are a GTK+ concept and only grab events away from other widgets in the
same
application. There is another, GDK-level grab; a GDK keyboard or
pointer grab
occurs on an X-server-wide basis, with other applications unable to
receive keyboard or mouse events. <br>
      <br>
To perform a GDK keyboard or pointer grab call the following
Gtk::Widget methods:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>Gdk::GrabStatus
keyboard_grab(bool
owner_events, unsigned int time);<br>
      <br>
Gdk::GrabStatus pointer_grab(Gdk::EventMaskField event_mask, Widget
*confine_to, Gdk::Cursor *cursor, bool owner_events, unsigned int time</code><code></code><code>);</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
A call to either of these functions overrides any previous keyboard or
pointer grab by this client. Most of the arguments in these two methods
have default values, so they're easy to use. The widget's GDK window
will own the grab until there is a corresponding call to
keyboard_ungrab() or pointer_ungrab(), or the grab widget becomes
unviewable. Like the GTK+ grab functions, keyboard_grab() must be
paired with a call to keyboard_ungrab(), and pointer_grab must be
paired with a call to pointer_ungrab().<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>void
Gdk::keyboard_ungrab(unsigned int
time = GDK_CURRENT_TIME);<br>
      <br>
      </code><code></code><code>void
Gdk::pointer_ungrab(unsigned int
time = GDK_CURRENT_TIME);</code><code><br>
      </code></div>
      <br>
These two functions ungrab for the default display only. To ungrab for
a specific display, there are two equivalent ungrab methods declared in
Gdk::Display.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Widget States</h3>
Widgets have states which determine their appearance. The exact meaning
and visual representation of a given state depends on the particular
widget and the current theme. A widget's state can be one of the
following values
from the Gtk::StateType enum:
      <ul>
        <li>STATE_NORMAL - just
like it sounds, the state during normal
operation.<br>
        </li>
        <li>STATE_ACTIVE - a
button is currently pressed in, or a check
box is currently checked, for example. </li>
        <li>STATE_PRELIGHT - the
mouse is over the widget (and
typically clicking would have some effect). Buttons "highlight" when
you move over them, for example. </li>
        <li>STATE_SELECTED - the
widget is in a list or other set of
alternatives, and is the currently selected option. </li>
        <li>STATE_INSENSITIVE -
the widget is inactive, or unresponsive
and will not respond to user input. </li>
      </ul>
You can retrieve the current state of a widget by calling the following
function:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox">Gtk::StateType
get_state() const;<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="W05"></a>Writing Your Own Widgets</h2>
Although XFC comes with many types of widgets that should cover your
most basic needs, there will come a time when you need to create your
own new widget type. Writing a new widget in XFC is a lot easier that
in GTK+. That's because C can only try to be an object orientated
language; C++ is inherently object orientated. How many times have you
had to rewrite C functions for a new widget. In C++ you write it once
and use it over and over again. But it's not all that simple. A new
widget written in XFC can only be used in an XFC application. If you
want a new widget that can be used by other language bindings then you
need to write the GTK+ widget in C.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Since XFC uses widget inheritance extensively, if there is already a
widget that is close to what you want, it is often possible to write a
useful new widget type in just a few lines of code. This is often the
case when writing a new compostie widget. Writing a new widget from
scratch is somewhat harder because it requires more code to implement.
If you are unfamiliar with writing your own widgets there are two
examples you can work through. The <a href="composite_widgets.html">Tictactoe</a>
example shows you how to write a new composite widget and the <a
 href="custom_widgets.html">Dial</a>
example shows you how to write a
new widget from scratch. Both examples are well documented and are
discussed in detail.<br>
