      <h1>Chapter
1: Basic XFC Application</h1>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">Every application starts out as an
empty main window consisting of
nothing more
than a frame, a title bar and a client area. In XFC, the most
basic application can be written in just 35 lines of code. I
have called this application 'XfcApp' but you can call it anything
you
like. <br>
      <br>
The header file for XfcApp is &lt;xfcapp.hh&gt;:<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>#include &lt;xfc/main.hh&gt;<br>
#include &lt;xfc/gtk/window.hh&gt;<br>
      <br>
using namespace Xfc;<br>
      <br>
class XfcApp : public Gtk::Window<br>
{<br>
public:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XfcApp();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual ~XfcApp();<br>
};<br>
      </code> </div>
      <div align="justify">
      <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
and the source file is &lt;xfcapp.cc&gt;:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>#include "xfcapp.hh"<br>
      <br>
XfcApp::XfcApp()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;set_title("XfcApp");<br>
}<br>
      <br>
XfcApp::~XfcApp()<br>
{<br>
}<br>
      <br>
int main (int argc, char *argv[])<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;using namespace Main;<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;XfcApp window;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;window.signal_destroy().connect(sigc::ptr_fun(&amp;Xfc::Main::quit));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window.show();<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;run();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;<br>
}</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h2>Compiling XfcApp</h2>
If you compiled and installed XFC yourself, you will find the source
code for XfcApp in the
&lt;examples/tutorial/chapter01&gt; source directory along with a Makefile. If
XFC came pre-installed, or you installed it from an RPM package, you
will
find the source code in the
&lt;/usr/share/doc/xfcui-X.X/examples/tutorial/chapter01&gt; subdirectory. In
this case you will have to create the Makefile yourself (replace X.X
with the
version number of the libXFCui library you have installed).<br>
      <br>
To create a Makefile for XfcApp, add the following lines to a new text
file
and save it using the name "Makefile":<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>CC = g++<br>
      <br>
CFLAGS = -Wall -O2<br>
      <br>
xfcapp: xfcapp.cc xfcapp.hh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$(CC) xfcapp.cc -o xfcapp $(</code><code>CFLAGS) </code><code>`pkg-config
xfcui-X.X
--cflags --libs`<br>
      <br>
clean: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;rm -f *.o xfcapp</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
If you cut and paste these lines make sure the whitespace before $(CC)
and rm is a tab character. When
you
compile and run this program you will see the following window appear:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 222px; height: 242px;" alt=""
 src="../../images/chapter01.png"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
If you look will notice that
the size
of
the binary file is 26.3 kbytes. This is much larger than the comparable
C program which is only 5.6 kbytes. Don't let this worry you. You have
to remember that in C++ you get all the object-oriented features
(encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism) built-in.
In C, you have to add everything yourself. Eventually though, any real
functional C program gets large enough that the difference between it
and a comparable C++ program is in the order of 5%. In todays world of
fast CPUs and large hard disks this difference is insignificant but the
benefits can be great! Convenience, easy code reuse, polymorphic
classes,
increased type safety, better program design and multiple programming
paradigms (generic, object orientated, procedural); I could go on.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Stepping through the source code</h2>
Looking at the header file first, &lt;xfcapp.hh&gt; includes 2
other header files:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>#include &lt;xfc/main.hh&gt;<br>
#include &lt;xfc/gtk/window.hh&gt;</code> </div>
      <br>
The first include &lt;xfc/main.hh&gt; is the main application header
file. It contains all the library initialization functions declared in
the
Main:: namespace. Every application must include this
header file. <br>
      <br>
The next include &lt;xfc/gtk/window.hh&gt; is the Gtk::Window header
file. Application main windows usually derive from Gtk::Window but they
may derive from Gtk::Dialog. If you include &lt;xfc/gtk/dialog.hh&gt;
you don't need to include &lt;xfc/gtk/window.hh&gt; as well because
Gtk::Dialog derives from Gtk::Window and automatically includes its
header file.<br>
      <br>
The next line opens the Xfc:: namespace so you don't have to prefix
every
type name with Xfc::<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>using namespace Xfc;</code></div>
      <br>
Don't be afraid to use namespaces in your application development.
They're the best way to partition a large program and to avoid the over
use
of type name prefixes to prevent name clashes.<br>
      <br>
The next few lines of code declare the XfcApp class:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>class XfcApp : public Gtk::Window<br>
{<br>
public:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;XfcApp();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;virtual ~XfcApp();<br>
};</code></div>
      <br>
As you can see XfcApp derives Gtk::Window. It has a constructor
that takes no arguments and it has a virtual destructor. The XFC object
hierarchy is polymorphic because its classes contain virtual functions,
so derived classes must have a virtual destructor.&nbsp; The primary
base class Xfc::Trackable declares its destructor virtual, so all
classes derived
from it, including XfcApp, automatically have a virtual destructor.
A virtual destructor just ensures that all derived classes deleted
through a
base class pointer are properly destructed.<br>
      <br>
Looking at the source file, &lt;xfcapp.cc&gt; first includes the XfcApp
header file. Then the XfcApp constructor is defined:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>XfcApp::XfcApp()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;set_title("XfcApp");<br>
}</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
The XfcApp constructor calls one function: set_title(),
which sets the name of the window in title bar to "XfcApp".
The set_title() function is declared in Gtk::Window. <br>
      <br>
The XfcApp destructor doesn't do anything so it is left empty. The
last function, main(), is the entry point for the application and is
declared the same in both C and C++. An XFC application's main()
function is where an instance of the main application window is created.<br>
      <br>
As previously stated, the namespace declaration opens the 'Main::'
namespace so that type names don't need to be prefixed with Main::<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>using namespace Main;</code></div>
      <br>
The init() function must be called before using any other XFC methods
in your application. init() initializes everything needed to operate
the library and parses some standard command line options. argc and
argv are adjusted accordingly so your own code will never see those
standard arguments.<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);</code></div>
      <br>
In the next two lines an instance of XfcApp is created on the stack
and its destroy signal is connected to the application's quit() method:<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>XfcApp window;<br>
window.signal_destroy().connect(sigc::ptr_fun(&amp;Xfc::Main::quit));</code><br>
      </div>
      <br>
XfcApp could have been created with operator new but if it was you
would not call operator delete. XFC memory management uses
reference counting which requires you to call ref() to hold onto a
reference to an object and to call unref() to release it. When an
object's
reference count reaches zero XFC automatically calls operator delete.<br>
      <br>
Having said that, if you create XfcApp with operator new you must
only call unref() if you first call ref(). This is because Gtk::Window
is an exception. GTK+ owns all top level windows and creates them with
a
reference count of one which GTK+ owns. So for a Gtk::Window if you
don't call ref() you don't need to call unref(). Instead the correct
way to destroy a top level window is to call its dispose() method,
which is declared in Gtk::Object.<br>
      <br>
Getting back to our application, if you create XfcApp with operator
new you don't need to call unref() or dispose(). The window's 'destroy'
signal is connected to the application's quit() method so that when the
main window is closed or destroyed, quit() automatically gets called.
The
proxy object returned by the call to signal_destroy() is used to make
this
connection. signal_destroy() is known as a proxy signal function and is
declared in Gtk::Object. sigc::ptr_fun() is a libsigc++ function call
that takes a pointer to a global function and returns a function slot.
Slots are type-safe C++ representations of callback methods and
functions.<br>
      <br>
The next line in the main() function calls show() to
display XfcApp's main window on screen, so that it is visible. The
show()
function is declared
in Gtk::Widget along with a complimentary hide() function that
makes a
widget invisible.<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>window.show();</code></div>
      <br>
The next line calls run() which runs the application's main event
loop. The main loop will run until quit() is called. You can nest calls
to
run(). In that case quit() will make the innermost invocation of the
main loop return.<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>run();</code></div>
      <br>
The last line is the main() function's return statement.&nbsp; The
return value doesn't do anything so zero is returned.<br>
      <br>
      <div class="fbox"><code>return 0;</code></div>
      <br>
Well that was easy. The <a href="chapter02.html">next chapter</a>
takes you through building another
simple XFC application: Hello World, which adds a button widget to a
main window and
connects it to a signal handler. In chapter 4 we will come back to
XfcApp again when we start building it into a functional main window
and fully compliant GNU autotools project. <br>
