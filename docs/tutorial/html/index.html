      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div align="justify">
      <div style="text-align: left;">GTK+ programming in C++ is more
efficient and more powerful than
progamming in C, and with the Xfce Foundation Classes (XFC)
it's a lot easier
and much more fun. By combining&nbsp; the power of <a
 href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+</a> and the power
of C++, XFC provides the programmer with a well integrated
set of C++ classes that wraps most of the functionality found in the
GTK+ libraries. XFC is divided into two main libraries: libXFCcore and
libXFCui, but other add-on libraries planned, such as libXFCde which
will provide a C++ interface for the Xfce core libraries.<br>
      <br>
The libXFCcore library wraps the GLib object system and selected
objects
from the GLIb utility library. Essentially, it provides a low level
object system that can be used to build other libraries; libXFCui
depends
on this library. libXFCcore uses the new libsigc++
2.0 callback library to implement a typesafe system of signals and
slots that makes using native GObject signals or creating your own
signals very easy. There is a standard string compatible UTF-8 string
class, reference documentation and several test programs.<br>
      <br>
The libXFCui library is a state-of-the-art graphical user interface
toolkit for developing GTK+ applications in C++. There are more than
420 classes that wrap most of the objects found in the ATK, GDK,
Gdk-Pixbuf, GTK and Pango libraries. Included is a full set of simple
example programs, a C++ version of the GTK+ widget demonstration
program, an extensive reference manual, several test programs and
this tutorial.<br>

      <h2>Programming in C++</h2>
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Over the
years application programming has become more complex. Today, C++ is a
better way the manage that complexity because it provides you with a
variety of programming designs, both object-oriented and conventional,
that let you
develop high-quality applications easily. Properly used, C++ code is
easily
maintainable, is extensible, and can be performance
and memory efficient.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
The <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Xfce Foundation Classes</span>
are a compact but comprehensive C++ wrapper around the GTK+ library.
XFC
judiciously uses C++ language features and does not layer on too much
extra C++ complexity. Its API is easy to understand and use, and
should feel immediately familiar to most GTK+ programmers. Throughout
its development XFC has maintained a good balance between remaining
faithful to GTK+ and remaining faithful to C++. Hence the catchphrase -
      <em>"the power of gtk, the power of c++</em>". <br>
      <br>
      <h2>The XFC Tutorial</h2>
Whether you're new to GTK+ or an experienced programmer, you should
find
the XFC tutorial beneficial and worthy of the small amount of time
it will take to work through. On completion of this tutorial you will
have
covered the basics of GTK+ programming in C++ using the Xfce Foundation
Classes. And for the
benefit of new programmers, the tutorial will discuss several important
GTK+ and GNU concepts along the way.<br>
      <br>
Rather than just working through the usual 'hello world' program, this
tutorial also takes you through the process building a real
application, called 'XfcApp', which you can use as a starting point for
your own projects. The tutorial starts off in <a href="chapter01.html">chapter
one</a> by creating a
basic application that is nothing
more than an empty main window. Then in chapters two and three, two
simple applications are created: Hello World and Hello Buttons. These
two applications serve to introduce you to important topics such as
packing widgets, libsigc++ signals and slots, and virtual signal
classes. <br>
      <br>
The interesting stuff really begins in chapter four. Starting with the
XfcApp program from chapter one, successive
chapters take you through the process of enhancing XfcApp, adding
features such as an action-based menubar and toolbar, a composite
statusbar that
looks and behaves just like
a GNOME appbar, and a
client area that responds to mouse button events by displaying a pop up
context menu. <br>
      <br>
The tutorial finishes off by covering two important topics that are
essential
for new programmers.
Chapter eight takes
you step-by-step through the process of turning XfcApp into a GNU
compliant
autotools project. Then chapter nine shows you how to add
international support. If you already know
how to build a GNU autotools project and how to add
international support, you can skip these two chapters.<br>
